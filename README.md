# BrightLight Sales Case Study

## Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive sales data analysis for BrightLight, simulating a real-world case study for a single product sold at a large retail store. The dataset consists of daily trading data and is analyzed to derive actionable business insights, key metrics, promotional impact, and strategic recommendations.

## Dataset Description

**Filename**: `Sales Case Study.csv`  
**Source**: Provided by BrightLight Analytics Team  
**Columns**:
- `Date`: Date of transaction
- `Sales`: Total Rand value of the sales
- `Cost of Sales`: Total cost associated with the sales
- `Quantity Sold`: Units sold on the day

---

##  Metrics Developed

1. **Daily Sales Price per Unit** = `Sales / Quantity Sold`
2. **Average Unit Sales Price** = `AVG(Sales / Quantity Sold)`
3. **Daily % Gross Profit** = `(Sales - Cost of Sales) / Sales`
4. **Gross Profit per Unit** = `(Sales - Cost of Sales) / Quantity Sold`
5. **Price Elasticity of Demand (PED)** for promotional periods

##  Visualizations

Created using **Excel**

## Promotion Periods Analyzed

- **Promo 1**: Jan–Feb 2014  
- **Promo 2**: Nov–Dec 2014  
- **Promo 3**: Mar–Apr 2015  

**Insight**: Product demonstrated moderate price sensitivity. Price discounts generally increased demand, but often at the expense of per-unit profitability.

## Key Insights

- Seasonal spikes in Q4 
- Discounts boost volume but reduce margin
- Weekday patterns show higher sales mid-week
- High variability in unit pricing—potential for price optimization

---

##  Recommendations

- Strategically time promotions during low-sales periods
- Reduce cost of sales to improve gross margin
- Use PED metrics to fine-tune discount levels
- Focus on consistent pricing to maintain customer trust
